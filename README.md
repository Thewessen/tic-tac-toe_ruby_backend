# tic-tac-toe (back-end)

This repo contains the backend for a tic-tac-toe game made in Emberjs.
The repo for the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/Thewessen/tic-tac-toe_emberjs).

I have no experience with the Ruby programming language. Let alone the Ruby on Rails
framework. I just recently divide into Laravel (php framework) which helped my
learning process quite a bit.

This app doesn't need much of a backend too run. But, creating this app also
for learning, I wanted to make the backend an almost equal part of the app.
