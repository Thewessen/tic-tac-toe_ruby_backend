# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Nickname.create([
  { name: 'Henk' },
  { name: 'Charlie' },
  { name: 'Bob' },
  { name: 'Alice' },
  { name: 'Claire' },
  { name: 'Sara' }
])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
